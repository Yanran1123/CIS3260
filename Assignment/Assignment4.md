+ Students may want to seek help from lab session, textbook, office hour, and online learning resources outlined in the syllabus.




+ Task 1: Here is the [code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mkp5mmcl12i6ic2/Code.pdf?dl=0) to display prime numbers. [Reference](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qefa76sps9avdxp/Ref1.pdf?dl=0)
 + [**15 points**] Create a method - **isPrime(int candidate) ** to check whether a number is prime. **candidate** is an integer formal parameter. It represents the number to be checked.
 + [**15 points**] Create a method - **printPrimeNumbers(int numberofprime)** to display prime numbers. **numberofprime** is an integer formal parameter that represents how many prime numbers will be displayed.
 + [**10 points**] In the main method, display printPrimeNumbers(100)
+ Task 2 [**10 points**]: Create another method - **printPrimeNumbers(int numberofprime, int numberperline)** to display prime numbers. **numberofprime** is an integer formal parameter that represents how many prime numbers will be displayed. **numberperline** is an integer formal parameter that represnts how many prime numbers will be displayed per line.
+ Task 3 [**10 points**]: 
+ Task 4 [**10 points**]: 

+ Code Documention [**10 points**]: The documentation should include
  + The problem the code is designed to solve
  + Programmer information (Name, email, etc.)
