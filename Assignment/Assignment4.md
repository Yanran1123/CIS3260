####Assignment 4 [**100 points**]

**Instructor's Comments:** 

+ The assignment is designed to develop stduents' capabilities to 
  + Convert a code block into a method
  + Sort elements in an array.
+ Students may want to seek help from lab session, textbook, office hour, and online learning resources outlined in the syllabus.


+ Question 1: Here is the [code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mkp5mmcl12i6ic2/Code.pdf?dl=0) to display prime numbers. [Hint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qefa76sps9avdxp/Ref1.pdf?dl=0)

 + Task 1: [**15 points**] Create a method - **isPrime(int candidate) ** to check whether a number is prime. **candidate** is an integer formal parameter. It represents the number to be checked.
 
 + Task 2: [**20 points**] Create a method - **printPrimeNumbers(int numberofprime, int numberperline)** to display prime numbers. **numberofprime** is an integer formal parameter that represents how many prime numbers will be displayed. **numberperline** is an integer formal parameter that represnts how many prime numbers will be displayed per line. To display prime numbers, you need to use **isPrime(int candidate)** method you created in Task1.
 
 + Task 3: [**10 points**] In the main method, display printPrimeNumbers(16,4)
 

+ Qustion 2: Here is a list of numbers {5,6,8,3,4,2,1,9,7}. [Hint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppfo834ix5l6u4v/Ref2.pdf?dl=0)
 + Task 1: [**10 points**] Create an array - **arrayA ** to store the numbers by the same order.
 + Task 2: [**20 points**] Use selection sorting method to sort the numbers in **arrayA** in ascending order. Display your ascending sorting result.
 + Task 3: [**10 points**] Diplay the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of the numbers.
 + Task 4 [**10 points**]: Use [buble sorting method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) to sort the numbers in **arrayA** in ascending order. Display your ascending sorting result.

+ Code Documention [**5 points**]: The documentation should include
  + The problem the code is designed to solve
  + Programmer information (Name, email, etc.)
  + Date
  + Comments for each line of your code


**Please submit the following documents to  the Dropbox in iCollege:**
+ Document 1 includes your source code (assignment4.java) [[A tutorial of how to locate a Java source code]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/422i7tz3zz17ay3/Locate%20a%20Java%20Source%20Code.pdf?dl=0)
+ Document 2 includes three screenshots of your console:
  + Question 1 Task 3
  + Question 2 Task 2
  + Question 2 Task 3
  + Question 2 Task 4
+ Document 3 (optional): You may also want to submit a Word document that elaborates any challenge you face while finishing the assignment and how you overcome the challenge.
