**The problem to address in this assignment: Identify all prime numbers in assignment2.csv.**

Now, let us break the problem into 4 tasks.
+ Task 1 [**5 points**]: Download and read [assignment2.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p61p387br7hts16/assignment2.csv?dl=0) into your computer.  [Hint: see demo code 4 in lecture 3]
+ Task 2 [**40 points**]: Extract all numbers and display 5 numbers per line. [Hint: see assignment 1, demo code 5 in lecture 3, and the [reference code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9zvhqcdv82ciopp/Reference%20Code.java?dl=0)]
+ Task 3 [**40 points**]: For all the numbers extracted in Task 2, identify all prime numbers. [Hint: see assignment 1]
+ Task 4 [**5 points**]: Display all prime numbers in one line. [Hint: see assignment 1]
+ Code Documention [**10 points**]: The documentation should include
  + The problem the code is designed to solve
  + Programmer information (Name, email, etc.)
  + Date
  + Comments for each code line



**Please submit the following documents to  the Dropbox in iCollege:**
+ Document 1 includes your source code (assignment2.java)
+ Document 2 includes two screenshots of your console:
  + All extracted numbers in Task 2
  + All prime numbers in Task 4 
+ Document 3 (optional): You may also want to submit a Word document that elaborates any challenge you face while finishing the assignment and how you overcome the challenge.
