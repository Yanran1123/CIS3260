**Instructor's Comments:** 

+ The project is designed to develop stduents' capabilities apply the programming skills to do
  + information extraction
  + sentiment analysis

Now, let us break the problem into 10 parts.
+ Task 1 [**5 points**]: Download and read [moviereview.txt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/41fo144dh7jhyt1/moviereview.txt?dl=0) into your computer.
+ Task 2 [**5 points**]: Extract all words in moviereview.txt.
+ Task 3 [**5 points**]: Lowercase all words.
+ Task 4 [**15 points**]: Calculate word frequence (i.e., how many times each word apprears in moviewreview.txt)
+ Task 5 [**15 points**]: Based on the word frequence you calculate in Task4, sort the words in a descending order and display the top 5 words and their frequence in the console by following the format below.  **The output below is not the answer.**
```
Top 5 words in moviereview.txt, organized in a descending order:

and appears 100 times
film appears 40 times
that appears 34 times
is appear 33 times
are appears 30 times
```

+ Task 6 [**5 points**]: Download and read [positive.txt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0cn3jbvhrlv7lk/positive.txt?dl=0) into your computer.
+ Task 7 [**5 points**]: Extract all words in positive.txt.
+ Task 8 [**5 points**]: Lowercase all words.
+ Task 9 [**15 points**]: Calculate word frequence (i.e., how many times each word in positive.txt appears in moviereview.txt)
+ Task 10 [**15 points**]: Based on the word frequence you calculate in Task 9, sort the words in a descending order and display the words with frequence greater than 5 in the console by following the format below.  **The output below is not the answer.**
```
Words in positive.txt that appear greater than 5 times in moviereview.txt, organized in a descending order:

satisfy appears 10 times
magical appears 9 times
great appears 7 times
sweet appear 7 times
particular appears 6 times
```

+ Code Documention [**10 points**]: The documentation should include
  + The problem the code is designed to solve
  + Programmer information (Name, email, etc.)
  + Date
  + Comments for each line of your code


**Please submit the following documents to  the Dropbox in iCollege:**
