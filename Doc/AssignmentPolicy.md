#### Assignment Policy

+ Each student is expected to complete and submit his or her assignments in the allocated time (see 5. Schedule for details). 
+ ***No late submission of an assignment will be accepted. An assignment that is past due date will be given zero.***
+ All files must be submitted through the corresponding assignment dropbox in [iCollege](icollege.gsu.edu). 
+ ***Submission through email is not accepted***. 
+ Make sure to submit all required files specified in the assignment. It is each student's responsibility to check the completeness of the files after the submission. ***An assignment with missing files will be graded with 50% penalty.***
+ Discussions of assignment solutions are highly recommended, but each student must turn in his or her own work. ***Plagiarism or duplicate  assignments will be given zero, a point deduction equivalent to one final grade level (i.e. from a B- to a C-), and a charge of academic dishonesty.  Both the student copying the assignment and the student supplying the copy will be penalized equally.***
