### 2. Learning Objectives - Change Your Way of Thinking and Seeing The World

 + **Concept**: Thoroughly understand the basic programming knowledge (i.e., elementary programming ,selections, and loops) as well as somewhat intermediate programming knowledge (i.e., methods, arrays, and objects & classes).
 + **Application**: Correctly apply these concepts to create, debug, execute, and test well-designed and readable applications in Java.
 + **Experience**: Creatively use programming thinking to identify a problem, break it into pieces, and write code to solve it.
 + **Impact**: The students are expected to see the forest beyond the trees (i.e., programming).
  + Briefly understand the most up-to-date technologies that are created by programming
  + Briefly understand the phenomenon that is shaped by those technologies.

### 3. Paths to Achieve The Learning Objectives

<img src="Pic/Paths.PNG" alt="paths" style="width: 1px;"/>

**Learn**
 
 + **Lecture**: 
  + Each lecture will introduce the ***core concepts*** in one topic and may include a demostration of how to ***apply*** the concepts to create, debug, execute, and test well-designed and readable applications in Java.
  + As the lecture is the main opportunity to learn, each student is expected to attend each lecture and activly interact with the instructor and fellow students during class discussion. Thus, ***attendence and interaction will be graded*** (See 4. Grading Policy for details.)
  + ***Lecture Slides*** will be available after each lecture on this website.
 + **Office Hour**: 
  + Office hour visit is ***highly recommended*** for the students who want to ***discuss concepts*** as these thoguhts are more difficult to grasp and require more information, discussion and time. Students may want to communicate with the instructor via email to ask questions regarding course logistics. 
  + [Office hour schedule](Doc/Office%20Hour%20Schedule.md) offers a general guideline for each office hour session. Students are ***welcome*** to ask other questions regarding the content of this course as well.
 + **Textbook**:
  +  Y. Daniel Liangï¼ŒIntroduction to Java programming, Comprehensive Version, 10th Edition [(Hardcopy Link on  Amazon.com)](https://www.amazon.com/Intro-Java-Programming-Comprehensive-Version/dp/0133761312/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1471567611&sr=8-2&keywords=Y.+Daniel+Liang%EF%BC%8CIntroduction+to+Java+programming)
  + Most content of the lecture will be based on the textbook. Thus, it is a good ***referece*** for students to ***prepare*** and ***review*** the class.
 + **See The Forest beyond The Trees**
  + 
 + **Online Learning Resources**: (additional ways for students to learn programming)
  + [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), offer free online courses from the world's best universities including MIT, Harvard, Berkeley, UT and others. *(Type keyword "java" to search free courses.)*
  + [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), an online community to ask and answer programming questions.
  + [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com), a video platform. *(Type keywords to search video tutorials. For example, how to install Java and set up [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) for [Java](https://java.com/en/) on your computer.)*
  + [Google](https://www.google.com/), a search engine.
