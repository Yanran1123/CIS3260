### 2. Learning Objectives - Change Your Way of Thinking about and Interacting with The World

 + **Concept**: Thoroughly understand the basic programming knowledge (i.e., elementary programming ,selections, and loops) as well as somewhat intermediate programming knowledge (i.e., methods, arrays, and objects & classes).
 + **Application**: Correctly apply these concepts to create, debug, execute, and test well-designed and readable applications in Java.
 + **Experience**: Creatively use programming thinking to identify a problem, break it into pieces, and write code to solve it.
 + **Impact**: Briefly understand the most up-to-date technologies that are created by programming and the phenomena that are shaped by those technologies.

### 3. Paths to Achieve The Learning Objectives

<img src="Pic/Paths.PNG" alt="paths" style="width: 1px;"/>

**Learn**
 
 + **Lecture**: 
  + Each lecture will introduce the ***core concepts*** in one topic and may include a demostration of how to ***apply*** the concepts to create, debug, execute, and test well-designed and readable applications in Java.
  + As the lecture is the main opportunity to learn, each student is expected to attend each lecture and activly interact with the instructor and fellow classmates during class discussion. Thus, ***attendence and interaction will be graded*** (see **4. Grading Policy** for details).
  + ***Lecture Slides*** will be available after each lecture on this website.
  + No audio recording, video recording, or photography is allowed without intructor's permission.
 + **Office Hour**: 
  + Office hour visit is ***highly recommended*** for the students who want to ***discuss concepts*** as these thoguhts are more difficult to grasp and require more information, discussion and time. Students may want to communicate with the instructor via email to ask questions regarding course logistics. 
  + [Office hour schedule](Doc/Office%20Hour%20Schedule.md) offers a general guideline for each office hour session. Students are ***welcome*** to ask other questions regarding the content of this course as well.
  + No audio recording, video recording, or photography is allowed without intructor's permission.
 + **Textbook**:
  +  Y. Daniel Liangï¼ŒIntroduction to Java programming, Comprehensive Version, 10th Edition [(Hardcopy Link on  Amazon.com)](https://www.amazon.com/Intro-Java-Programming-Comprehensive-Version/dp/0133761312/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1471567611&sr=8-2&keywords=Y.+Daniel+Liang%EF%BC%8CIntroduction+to+Java+programming)
  + Most content of the lecture will be based on the textbook. Thus, it is a good ***referece*** for students to ***prepare*** and ***review*** the class.
 + **See The Forest beyond The Trees**:
  + This module is designed to empower students to criticaly think about the big picture - the impact of programming.
  + Starting from Lecture 2, the instructor will allocate 10 mins to briefly introduce the most up-to-date technologies that are created by programming or the phenomena that are shaped by those technologies in each lecture.
  + The students are expected to (1) watch videos and/or read articles after class, and (2) discuss the questions assigned by the instructor with fellow classmeates after class.
  + This module will be tested in the mideterm and fianl exam.
 + **Online Learning Resources**: (additional ways for students to learn programming)
  + [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), offer free online courses from the world's best universities including MIT, Harvard, Berkeley, UT and others. *(Type keyword "java" to search free courses.)*
  + [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), an online community to ask and answer programming questions.
  + [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com), a video platform. *(Type keywords to search video tutorials. For example, how to install Java and set up [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) for [Java](https://java.com/en/) on your computer.)*
  + [Google](https://www.google.com/), a search engine.

 
**Practice**

 + **Lab Session**: 
  + Lab session is ***highly recommended*** as it provides opportunities to ***digest and practice*** what the instructor teach in the lecture.
  + Time: Wednesday 2:30 - 4:00 PM and Friday 1:00 - 2:30 PM
  + Location: Room 100-S, J. Mack Robinson College of Business, [Map](https://github.com/zhitaoyin/CIS3260/blob/master/Pic/ClassroomLocation.PNG)
 
 + **Assignment**:
  + The assignment is designed to (1) reinforce stduents' understanding of the key concepts of programming, and (2) develop students' capabilities to correctly apply these concepts to create, debug, execute, and test well-designed and readable applications in Java. 
  + All assignments will be posted on this website (see **5. Schedule** for details).
  + Each student is expected to complete and submit his or her assignments in the allocated time (see **5. Schedule** for details). All assignments will be graded (see **4. Grading Policy** for details).
  + ***No late submission of an assignment will be accepted. An assignment that is past due date will be given zero.***
  + All files must be submitted through the corresponding assignment dropbox in [iCollege](http://icollege.gsu.edu), see [the instruction of how to submit a file to iCollege](Doc/iCollegeInstruction.md). 
  + ***Submission through email is not accepted***. 
  + Make sure to submit all required files specified in the assignment. It is each student's responsibility to check the completeness of the files after the submission. ***An assignment with missing files will be graded with 50% penalty.***
  + Discussion of assignment solutions are highly recommended, but each student must turn in his or her own work. ***Plagiarism or duplicate  assignments will be given zero, a point deduction equivalent to one final grade level (i.e. from a B- to a C-), and a charge of academic dishonesty.  Both the student copying the assignment and the student supplying the copy will be penalized equally.***

 + **Project**:
  + The project is designed to give students' hands-on experience to creatively use programming thinking to identify a problem, break it into pieces, and write code to solve it. 
  + The project will include three modules and will be posted on this website (see **5. Schedule** for details).
  + Each student is expected to complete and submit his or her project in the allocated time (see **5. Schedule** for details). Each module will be graded (see **4. Grading Policy** for details).
  + ***No late submission of a module will be accepted. A module that is past due date will be given zero.***
  + All files must be submitted through the corresponding project dropbox in [iCollege](http://icollege.gsu.edu), see [the instruction of how to submit a file to iCollege](Doc/iCollegeInstruction.md). 
  + ***Submission through email is not accepted***. 
  + Make sure to submit all required files specified in the project module. It is each student's responsibility to check the completeness of the files after the submission. ***A module with missing files will be graded with 50% penalty.***
  + Discussion of project solutions are highly recommended, but each student must turn in his or her own work. ***Plagiarism or duplicate  assignments will be given zero, a point deduction equivalent to one final grade level (i.e. from a B- to a C-), and a charge of academic dishonesty.  Both the student copying the assignment and the student supplying the copy will be penalized equally.***


**Test**

 + Exams are designed to test (1) stduents' understanding of the key concepts of programming, (2) their capabilities to correctly apply these concepts to create, debug, execute, and test well-designed and readable applications in Java, and (3) their critical thinking about the most up-to-date technologies that are created by programming and the phenomena that are shaped by those technologies.
 + There will be one midterm exam (2.5 hours) and one final exam (2.5 hours).
 + All exames will be graded (see **4. Grading Policy** for details).
 + Make-up exams will ***not*** be given. 
  + Students missing an exam will receive a zero on that exam.  
  + Exams may be taken early if the instructor is given a legitimate reason (jury duties, religious holiday, scheduled surgeries, pregnancy, etc.). 
  + Proof of reasons must be scanned and sent to the instructor ahead of time (unless absence was due to a legitimate emergency, in which case scanned proof must be sent afterwards).
 + Exams will be closed-book.
  + No cheat(note) sheet is allowed to use during exams.
  + No electronic device (e.g., cellphone, laptop) is allowed to use during exams.
